            <h2>Hello There!</h2>
            <p> My name is Katrina Ezis and today I'd like to show you some of my work! But first, let me tell you a little bit about me. I'm a senior at the University of Washington, which means I'm about to be forced out into the real world real soon! I study informatics, but also like to camp, read, create, and learn. Now that we're done with introductions, let's get onto the good stuff!</p>
            <a href="#start"><div class="button">Let's get started</div></a>
        </div>

        <!-- Main content. Includes three little blurbs about some projects I've worked on. -->
        <div class="main" id="start">
            <div class="content">
                <img src="img/PocketHipster.png">
                <p class="container"><span class="underline">Pocket Hipster</span> This was one of my first websites ever build. It was created in just under 24 hours at Dubhacks, a Washington hackaton. It takes in an image and writes a free-verse poem for your enjoyment. It's like having a hipster with you wherever you go! We ended up winning second place for this, which was amazing and still one of my proudest moments to date!</p>
            </div>

        <div class="main">
            <div class="content">
                <img src="img/Pinpoint.png">
                <p class="container"><span class="underline">Pinpoint</span> is the product of design thinking and user research. It is an app that helps college students (or anyone, really) find events to go to nearby. This was one of the first projects that I did user interviews and created use cases! I also did a full write-up for it explaining our thinking and how we made our design choices.</p>
            </div>

        <div class="main">
            <div class="content">
                <img src="img/RateAHipster.png">
                <p class="container"><span class="underline">Rate-A-Hipster</span> is a CRUD application that used parse (may it rest in peace) to write little reviews about a couple of hipsters. I tried to use my best hipster design practices in making this website both functional, but also have a great user interface that is as hipster as can be!</p>

                <p>Each of these projects taught me a little bit more about web development and inspired me to keep learning and growing. I have many more projects that I have worked on before and after these, but selected these particular projects because each holds a special place in my heart.</p>
                <p>If you would like to learn more about these project, please see the provided links. I'll also link my portfolio below, just in case you want to view a bit more of my work! I'd also like to thank you for taking a bit of time to peruse some of the cool things I've worked on! I'm so very excited to be considered for IBM Design and can't wait to show you more!</p>

            <!-- I wanted to do a take on the IBM Design logo using your icons. I chose each website that each of the symbols links to very carefully. The I is for inspirational websites. This is where I'll go if I need a little web design inspiration. The B is for beautiful design. This blog helps me make beautiful design choices. And M is for me. It just links to my portfolio. -->
